# setting up Python environment in EC2

1. access ec2:
windows environment: putty in jump box
Linux environment: AWS CLI

2.python code deployment workflow:

*bitbucket->teamcity->octupus->s3
*startup script->pull code from s3->extract the code-> run
Note:
ec2: when ec2 starts, it runs startup script, which pull code from s3, extract the code, and run.
bitbucket push triggers teamcity to run unit tests, teamcity generates zip file, octopus uploads 
the zip file to s3. when ec2 starts,  it runs a startup script, which will pull code from s3, extract the code, and RUN
