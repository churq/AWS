# setting up Python environment in EC2

1. access ec2:
windows environment: putty in jump box
Linux environment: AWS CLI

2.python code deployment workflow:

*bitbucket->teamcity->octupus->s3
*startup script->pull code from s3->extract the code-> run
Note:
ec2: when ec2 starts, it runs startup script, which pull code from s3, extract the code, and run.
bitbucket push triggers teamcity to run unit tests, teamcity generates zip file, octopus uploads 
the zip file to s3. when ec2 starts,  it runs a startup script, which will pull code from s3, extract the code, and RUN
  

3 install python on EC2 linux:
*sudo yum install python35
or
*sudo apt-get install python 3.5
 
*to see if pip is installed:
 command -v pip

4 A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places,
by creating virtual Python environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, 
Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.
